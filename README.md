# Elementary: The Game 

A fusion of chemistry and game development. 

Elementary is a game about the existence of the Primal forms of each element: with their destruction, all atoms of the element cease to exist. Its an indie game about Jerome Krane who merges with the prime essence of Carbon, and with their combined abilities and wisdom, Carbon-Jerome save the world. 

A reboot of the game Element War, attempted in Fall 2018. 

Credits and dedicated to Ali Mohammed Shujjat, Sara Jameel, and Syed Sarim Zuhair for all the help and contributions they have made to this idea: if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be redoing this project. 

To learning, improving, and righting wrongs.
